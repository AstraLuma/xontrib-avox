# xontrib-avox
Xontrib for Xonsh that automatically activates and deactivates virtual environments as you `cd` around. It's based on the idea of projects and projects living in specific directories.

For example, if you've set `$PROJECT_DIRS = ["~/code"]` and have the project directory `~/code/spam`, avox will use the venv name `spam`.

It's required to configure `$PROJECT_DIRS`:
